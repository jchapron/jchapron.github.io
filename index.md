I am JÃ©rÃ´me ðŸ‘‹

I am currently the tech lead at Shopmium, where I help build the future of
cashback. I mostly work with Ruby but sometimes I venture into some other
ecosystems like Javascript.

I am passionate about coding and use this blog to share some of my ideas and
explorations.

I am always interested in hearing some feedback so don't hesitate to hit me up
